# Seoplus+ theme

## About The Project

A modified child theme for Understrap by seoplus+ team. Comes with a modified burger menu, scroll to top button, and a basic setup for ACF flexible content

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Download this theme and install on your wordpress site. To get the custom field setup, go to custom fields, then click on "Sync Available" and sync them (this is just a test). This will give you a setup for flexible content with 3 components (work in progress). To add more - add the fields and then use the id of that field as a name for the php file under seoplus/components. For example, the id of the component is content_cards, so the path should be seoplus/components/content_cards.php. To see your flexible content on a page - select "Flexible content" as a template for that page.
